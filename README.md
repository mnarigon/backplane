# S-100 Bus Backplane

This repository contains the Kicad 7 design files for a 10-slot, Integrand chassis compatible, actively terminated S-100 bus backplane.

This design is in the prototype stage, where I am currently having the first boards manufactured. I will update as I test out the prototype.

I have received the rev --- prototype boards and done fit-checks on the footprints. I plan to test out the 2.7V supply circuitry using the rev --- prototype boards.

I spent some more time researching transmission line termination. I have concluded that providing active termination on the open-collector lines is beneficial. So, I have updated the design to rev A and provided active termination on all the non-power lines. I will wait until I check out the 2.7V supply circuitry to have rev A manufactured.
