# S-100 Bus Backplane

This repository contains the Kicad 7 design files for a 10-slot, Integrand chassis compatible, actively terminated S-100 bus backplane.

This design is in the prototype stage, where I am currently having the first boards manufactured. I will update as I test out the prototype.
